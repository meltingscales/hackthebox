As Wade completed all the missions of the OASIS, he is now to sign the final contract. Thus, he received an email from the OASIS legal department with a document attached. Although it is a part of the procedure, Wade was suspicious about the domain of the mail, which was "legaldep@0asis.com". Can you analyze the document and make sure it is not another trap of the IOI group?
